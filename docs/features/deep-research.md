# Deep Research

Aesoperator's deep research capability allows it to perform comprehensive research and analysis on a given topic by ingesting and processing information from multiple online sources.

## How It Works

At a high level, the deep research process involves:

1. Navigating to relevant webpages and online resources based on the research topic
2. Extracting key information from the page text, images, and other media 
3. Storing and indexing the extracted information in memory
4. Analyzing patterns and connections across the ingested data to generate novel insights
5. Summarizing the key findings in a digestible format

Under the hood, this is powered by:
- The MCP (Multi-Channel Processing) protocol to efficiently ingest and process data from multiple online sources in parallel
- A suite of computer vision and language understanding models to extract structured information from unstructured web data
- A knowledge graph stored in memory to identify relationships between entities and concepts 
- Large language models to analyze the aggregated knowledge and generate human-readable insights and summaries

## Using the Research Capability

To perform research using Aesoperator:
1. Provide a research topic or question 
2. Specify any constraints or guidelines for the research process
3. Submit the request to the Aesoperator API
4. Aesoperator will automatically navigate the web to gather relevant information 
5. Once the research is complete, it will return a summarized report of its findings

Note: The exact details of Aesoperator's deep research implementation are not provided in the current docs. This overview is based on inferences from the high-level descriptions and should be considered speculative.
