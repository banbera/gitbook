# Tokenomics

## Token Overview

* Total supply: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) AESOP tokens
* Majority of supply (89.87%) locked in LP until February 28th, 2025 ([Verify on Rugcheck](https://rugcheck.xyz/tokens/CpEpquNgiGyeMeTBrJJCgMXL8vn1jCkWKVbSurhJpump))
* 0.7% team allocation via Streamflow until February 28th, 2025
* Team (of 2) holds minimal tokens which ensured fair launch

## Access Passes

### Primary Funding Mechanism

Access passes are our main way of raising funds to develop and operate Aesoperator:

* Maximum supply: 10,000 passes
* Duration: 6 months access, converting to pay-per-hour after
* Price: 1 SOL per pass

### Treasury & Operations

* Treasury wallet: GvBQMHcP2BmtQjR5pHr5Vij4qV1tvpEy47HGmUhbN1ea
* Monthly operational costs: ~~50 SOL (~~$12,000)
  * H100 GPUs
  * OpenRouter API access
  * Infrastructure and hosting
* Token allocation secured via [Streamflow contract](https://app.streamflow.finance/contract/solana/mainnet/HCym2tDaV1eZFkfpBns6RABKufVcbmXxFApg9jPkiweY)

## Future Utility

### Q1 2025: Pay-per-hour Model

* 10,000 AESOP per hour as compute costs scale with more complex reasoning

### Q2 2025: Rate Limit Tiers

* Basic: 100 requests/day
* Standard: 1,000 requests/day

## Fund Usage

* Aquisitions of projects and teams
* Infrastructure costs (GPUs, APIs, hosting)
* Development team
* Bug bounties
* Operations and maintenance
* Platform improvements
* Community incentives

Note: We haven't raised funds through token sales. All funding comes through access pass sales to support aquiring other projects and teams and development costs. We see aquisitions as a way to buy distribution to the Aesoperator project.
