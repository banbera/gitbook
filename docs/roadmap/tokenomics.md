# Tokenomics

## ACT 1: $AESOP

* Total supply: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) AESOP tokens
* 89.87% burned and locked in LP ([Verify on Rugcheck](https://rugcheck.xyz/tokens/CpEpquNgiGyeMeTBrJJCgMXL8vn1jCkWKVbSurhJpump))
* 0.7% team allocation locked until February 28th, 2025([Verify on Streamflow](https://app.streamflow.finance/contract/solana/mainnet/HCym2tDaV1eZFkfpBns6RABKufVcbmXxFApg9jPkiweY))
* Team (of 2 currrently) holds minimal tokens which ensured fair launch

## Access Passes

Access passes are our main way of raising funds to develop and operate Aesoperator ACT 1:

* Maximum supply: 5555
* Duration: 6 months access, converting to pay-per-hour after
* Price: .55 SOL per pass

### Treasury & Operations

* Treasury wallet: GvBQMHcP2BmtQjR5pHr5Vij4qV1tvpEy47HGmUhbN1ea
* Monthly operational costs
  * H100 GPUs
  * OpenRouter API access
  * Infrastructure and hosting
* Token allocation secured via [Streamflow contract](https://app.streamflow.finance/contract/solana/mainnet/HCym2tDaV1eZFkfpBns6RABKufVcbmXxFApg9jPkiweY)

## Utility

Pay-per-hour Model

* 10,000 AESOP per hour as compute costs scale with more complex reasoning
* ACT 2

## Fund Usage

* Acquisitions of projects and teams
* Infrastructure costs (GPUs, APIs, hosting)
* Development team
* Bug bounties
* Operations and maintenance
* Platform improvements
* Community incentives

Note: We haven't raised funds through $AESOP. All funding comes through access pass sales to support aquiring other projects and teams and development costs. We see aquisitions as a way to buy distribution to the Aesoperator project.
