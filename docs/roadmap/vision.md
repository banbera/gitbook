# Vision

Aesoperator is a platform for AI agents to interact with computers.

OpenAI Operator showed us last week that Computer Usage Agents are the next modality. We are building the open source version of this.

## We developed a Computer Usage Agent. Next, we enabled its use on Telegram and Discord. We plan to use treasury funds to acquire other projects and their distributions. This will transition the Computer Agent from a browser-based tool to a locally run application on your computer, similar to how Devin and Cursor work.

## Core Capabilities

* **Universal Computer Access**: AI agents that can navigate any GUI interface, web application, or system through screenshots and actions
* **Natural Interaction**: Using computer vision and LLMs to understand and interact with interfaces naturally
* **Memory & Context**: Maintaining persistent memory of interactions and system states
* **Function Composition**: Building complex workflows by combining atomic operations

## Key Differentiators

* **Screenshot-First**: Unlike traditional automation tools that rely on selectors or coordinates, Aesoperator "sees" interfaces through screenshots
* **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains awareness of system state and previous actions
* **Serverless Architecture**: Dynamically spins up operators for specific tasks without maintaining persistent infrastructure
* **Open Protocol**: MCP (Model Context Protocol from Anthropic) enables standardized communication between AI and tools, allowing us to integrate with every existing RAG or Agentic system that supports it.

## Technical Foundation

* Vision language models for interface understanding
* Large language models for reasoning and decision making
* Persistent memory systems(RAG) for maintaining context
* Serverless compute for scalable execution
* Browser and system automation capabilities

## Target Use Cases

1. **Research & Analysis**
   * Gathering data from multiple sources
   * Processing and synthesizing information
   * Generating comprehensive reports
2. **Workflow Automation**
   * Complex multi-step processes
   * Cross-application workflows
   * Data entry and validation
3. **System Administration**
   * Monitoring and maintenance
   * Resource management
   * Issue diagnosis and resolution
4. **Development & Testing**
   * UI testing automation
   * Bug reproduction
   * Development environment setup

## Future Roadmap

1. **Q1 2025**
   * O3-mini high and DeepSeek R1-Zero integration
